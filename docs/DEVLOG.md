## 2025-08-16: Providers Integration & Gemini Key Rotation

### Task: feat/providers-groq-together-gemini-rotation

Implementing comprehensive provider integration including:
- New providers: Groq, Together, OpenRouter, Google AI Studio (GAIS)
- Multi-key rotation for Gemini API calls
- Per-model rate limiting
- Paid model gating

### Progress

#### 1. Branch Creation ✓
- Created feature branch: `feat/providers-groq-together-gemini-rotation`
- Started development log

#### 2. Environment Setup ✓
- Merged `.env.new` configuration (files were identical)
- Created backup: `.env.bak.20250816_182326`
- All required API keys configured including 5 Google AI Studio keys

#### 3. Models Configuration ✓
- Backed up existing `config/models.yaml` to `config/models.yaml.bak.20250816_182348`
- Merged `models.yaml.new` with existing configuration
- Added comprehensive provider definitions for all new providers
- Preserved legacy model configurations
- Added 70+ new model routes from OpenRouter, Together, and Google AI Studio

#### 4. Provider Adapters ✓
- Created `connectors/providers/groq.py` - OpenAI-compatible HTTP provider
- Created `connectors/providers/together.py` - OpenAI-compatible HTTP provider  
- Created `connectors/providers/google_ai_studio.py` - Advanced provider with:
  - Multi-key rotation (round-robin strategy)
  - Automatic failover on HTTP 429 errors
  - Persistent key index in `.cache/google_ai_studio.keyidx`
  - Configurable cooldown periods (60s default)
  - Paid model gating via `USE_PAID_MODELS` env var
- Updated CLI providers (`codex_cli.py`, `claude_code.py`) to match models.yaml commands
- Updated `connectors/providers/__init__.py` to export all new providers

#### 5. Rate Limiting System ✓
- Created `config/limits.yaml` with per-model RPM/TPM limits for all providers
- Implemented `core/rate_limiter.py` with:
  - Sliding window rate limiting (60-second windows)
  - Per-model request and token tracking
  - Smart sleep/fallback strategies
  - Configurable limits per provider and model
  - Default fallback limits for unconfigured models

#### 6. Router Enhancement ✓
- Updated `core/router.py` with:
  - Integration of all new providers (groq, together, google_ai_studio)
  - Rate limiting integration with sleep/fallback logic
  - Enhanced paid model gating using `USE_PAID_MODELS` env var
  - New model ID routing alongside legacy role-based routing
  - Comprehensive routing trace logging with latency tracking
  - Token estimation and usage recording

#### 7. Documentation ✓
- Moved `READ_ME_KEY_ROTATION.md` to `config/` directory
- Created comprehensive `README.md` with:
  - Full environment variable documentation
  - Key rotation explanation
  - Rate limiting guide
  - Configuration examples
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Project structure overview

#### 8. Testing ✓
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/`:
  - `test_rotation_google.py` - Google AI Studio key rotation testing
  - `test_rate_limit.py` - Rate limiting functionality testing
  - `test_router_paid_flag.py` - Paid model gating testing
- 30+ test cases covering key rotation, rate limiting, and paid model scenarios
- Fixed async test setup with pytest-asyncio integration

#### 9. QA & Validation ✓
- Successfully ran `make setup && make lint && make test`
- Code formatting and linting applied via ruff
- Rate limiting functionality validated with sliding window logic
- Key rotation persistence and fallback mechanisms tested

#### 10. Project Completion ✓
- Committed all changes with comprehensive commit message
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ .env contains all new keys; existing values preserved
  - ✅ config/models.yaml lists groq, together, openrouter, google_ai_studio with api_keys array
  - ✅ GAIS adapter rotates keys on 429 & persists index to .cache/google_ai_studio.keyidx
  - ✅ Router enforces per-model rpm/tpm; falls back or sleeps safely
  - ✅ USE_PAID_MODELS=false skips paid models in chains
  - ✅ make lint && make test succeed
  - ✅ README updated; rotation guide present in config/
